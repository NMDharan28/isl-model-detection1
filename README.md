# isl-model-detection1

**Description:**

This project is an Indian Sign Language (ISL) Sign Gesture Detection model designed to foster engaging communication between deaf and mute individuals and those without hearing or speaking impairments. The model utilizes deep learning and is built using TensorFlow.js. It is deployed on the cloud and rendered via HTML for easy access and usability.

This is our **SIH** project (Team INVADERS)

**Key Features:**

Deep Learning-based ISL Gesture Recognition: The model is trained using TensorFlow.js to detect and interpret various sign language gestures in real-time.
Cloud Deployment: The model is hosted on the cloud, making it easily accessible from anywhere via a simple browser interface.
HTML Integration: The model is rendered on a user-friendly HTML interface, providing seamless interaction for users.
